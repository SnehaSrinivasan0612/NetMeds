# Health Record App
This is a web app that was created as a part of Hack-a-Week Hackathon conducted by IEEE CET.
<br>
**Problem:**
The maintenance of personal health records without misplacing them is a hassle for many. So, patients are in need of a tool that can be used to accumulate all of their prescriptions, diagnoses and medical reports in one place.
<br>
**Solution:**
Keeping these issues in mind, we intend to build a web app that can aggregate all tests, prescriptions and checkups in one place, and compare the results over time.
